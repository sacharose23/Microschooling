### **Fall and Winter Harvest Crops:**

#### **1. Onions (Short-Day Onions):**

- **Planting:** Start planting short-day onions directly in your raised bed in late summer (August to early September).
- **Growth:** These onions will grow through the fall and into winter.
- **Harvest:** Expect to harvest in late fall or early winter when the tops fall over and turn yellow.

#### **2. Lettuce:**

- **Planting:** Sow lettuce seeds directly in the bed in late summer (August to September).
- **Growth:** Lettuce can tolerate light frosts and will grow well into fall. The hinged house hoop can protect it during colder snaps.
- **Harvest:** You can start harvesting baby greens in 4-6 weeks or wait for mature heads later in fall.

#### **3. Spinach:**

- **Planting:** Sow spinach seeds directly in the bed in late summer to early fall (August to September).
- **Growth:** Spinach thrives in cooler temperatures and can survive light frosts.
- **Harvest:** Harvest spinach in 6-8 weeks, or allow it to grow longer under protection for a continuous harvest into winter.

#### **4. Broccoli:**

- **Planting:** Start broccoli seeds indoors in mid-summer (July to early August) and transplant them into the raised bed in late summer.
- **Growth:** Broccoli can withstand cooler temperatures, and your hoop house will provide extra protection.
- **Harvest:** Harvest broccoli heads in late fall or early winter. Side shoots may continue to produce after the main head is harvested.

#### **5. Carrots:**

- **Planting:** Sow carrot seeds directly in the bed in late summer (August).
- **Growth:** Carrots can be left in the ground during winter and harvested as needed.
- **Harvest:** Carrots will be ready in about 60-80 days, but they can stay in the ground for winter harvesting as long as the ground doesn’t freeze solid.

### **Tips to Ensure a Fall/Winter Harvest:**

1. **Start Early Enough:** Begin planting in mid to late summer, giving your crops time to mature before the first hard frost, usually around late October or November in Zone 7.
2. **Frost Protection:** Utilize your hinged house hoop to protect your crops from frost. It can also help create a microclimate that extends the growing season, especially for more tender crops like lettuce and spinach.
3. **Cold-Tolerant Varieties:** Choose varieties that are known for their cold hardiness. For example, winter spinach, cold-resistant lettuce varieties, and frost-tolerant broccoli are good choices.
4. **Mulching:** Apply a layer of mulch around your plants to help regulate soil temperature and retain moisture as the weather cools down.
5. **Succession Planting:** Consider planting in intervals (every 2-3 weeks) to ensure a continuous harvest throughout the fall and winter.

### Seed Sowing Recommendations:

- **Carrots**: Sow directly outdoors because they don’t transplant well.
- **Onions**: Sow 20-30% more seeds than the number of plants you need to ensure you have enough strong transplants.
- **Spinach**: Over-sow slightly to account for weaker seedlings.
- **Lettuce**: Similarly, sow more seeds to ensure you have enough strong plants.
