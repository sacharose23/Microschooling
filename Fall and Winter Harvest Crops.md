#### Additional Details:

**Kale**: Harvest outer leaves continuously, starting 8-10 weeks after transplanting.

**Spinach**: Harvest leaves as needed using the “cut and come again” method, typically 6-8 weeks after transplanting.

**Bok Choy**: Harvest outer leaves for continuous harvest or harvest the whole plant when mature, approximately 6-8 weeks after transplanting.

**Arugula**: Harvest leaves as needed starting 4-6 weeks after transplanting.

**Lettuce**: Harvest leaves or heads depending on the variety, usually 6-8 weeks after transplanting.

### Step-by-Step Plan: Seed to Harvest

#### **4th Week of August**

1. **Start Seeds Indoors:**
   - Use seed starter trays with a high-quality seed-starting mix.
   - **Broccoli**: Sow 2-3 seeds per cell.
   - **Spinach**: Sow 2-3 seeds per cell.
   - **Bok Choy**: Sow 2-3 seeds per cell.
   - **Stringless Beans**: You can start these indoors or directly sow them in the garden. If starting indoors, sow 2 seeds per cell.
   - **Lettuce**: Sow 2-3 seeds per cell.
   - Keep the trays in a warm location with indirect light. Ensure consistent moisture.
2. **Seedling Care:**
   - Thin seedlings to one strong plant per cell once they have a couple of true leaves.
   - Provide adequate light (using grow lights if necessary) and maintain soil moisture.
   - Begin hardening off the seedlings in about 2 weeks by gradually exposing them to outdoor conditions.

#### **2nd-3rd Week of September**

1. **Prepare Raised Bed:**
   - **Clear the Bed**: Remove any existing plants, weeds, and debris.
   - **Soil Preparation**: Incorporate organic compost, aged manure, or worm castings to enrich the soil. Test the soil pH and amend if necessary (ideal pH for these crops: 6.0-7.0).
   - **Plan for Spacing**: Ensure proper spacing between plants to optimize growth.
2. **Transplant Seedlings Outdoors:**
   - **Broccoli**: Transplant seedlings at 18 inches apart.
   - **Spinach**: Transplant seedlings at 4-6 inches apart.
   - **Bok Choy**: Transplant seedlings at 6-12 inches apart.
   - **Stringless Beans**: If you didn’t start these indoors, you can directly sow them now. Space them 4-6 inches apart.
   - **Lettuce**: Transplant seedlings at 6-8 inches apart.
3. **Install Hinged Hoop House:**
   - Construct and place the hoop house over the bed to protect the seedlings from extreme temperatures and pests.

#### **Late September - October**

1. **Care and Maintenance:**
   - **Watering**: Maintain consistent moisture, particularly as temperatures fluctuate.
   - **Fertilizing**: Apply a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10) at transplanting and again mid-season for broccoli and bok choy.
   - **Weeding**: Keep the bed weed-free to reduce competition for nutrients.
2. **Pest Management:**
   - **Common Pests**: Aphids, cabbage worms, flea beetles, slugs, and leaf miners.
   - Prevention and Control:
     - Use floating row covers to protect against pests.
     - Apply neem oil or insecticidal soap if aphids are present.
     - Handpick or use slug traps to manage slugs.
     - Regularly inspect plants for signs of pests and address promptly.

#### **November - January**

1. Harvest:
   - **Spinach**: Harvest leaves as needed using the “cut and come again” method, typically 6-8 weeks after transplanting.
   - **Lettuce**: Harvest leaves or heads depending on the variety, usually 6-8 weeks after transplanting.
   - **Bok Choy**: Harvest outer leaves for continuous harvest or the whole plant when mature, approximately 6-8 weeks after transplanting.
   - **Broccoli**: Harvest the main head when it’s fully developed but before the buds open, usually 10-12 weeks after transplanting. Smaller side shoots will develop after the main head is harvested.
   - **Stringless Beans**: Harvest beans when they are young and tender, typically 7-8 weeks after planting.

#### **Post-Harvest (Late January - February)**

1. Prepare for Next Season:
   - **Remove Spent Plants**: Clear the bed of any plant debris and add it to your compost.
   - **Soil Care**: Add a layer of compost or organic matter to rejuvenate the soil.
   - **Cover Crop (Optional)**: Plant a cover crop like clover or rye to improve soil health and prevent erosion.
   - **Plan for Spring Planting**: Consider rotating crops to prevent disease buildup and improve soil fertility.
