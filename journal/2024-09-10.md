## Major Accomplishments

*  When the kids separated they said "Have a good day!" to one another and when they rejoined they asked each other what they learned and what they made. SO CUTE! They were genuinely interested and had an independent conversation.
*  Kai's addition and understanding teens was very impressive today

## Activities and events (outside of the house)
* Farm School at Urban Roots for Kai (roasted tomatoes)
* Little Sprouts for Rose (Topic: Harvest; she made a fruit tree)


## Projects (inside of the house)
* 


## Lessons
* Reading/Writing
  
* Math/Business
    * Good & Beautiful Math lesson (haven't touched this in a long time!)
        * Lesson about TEENS (Kai did very well counting, understanding teens more for example 10 and 4 make 14, etc. AND traditional addition 2 + 3 etc.)
    
* Geography
    * Introduced our home address

    * Reviewed my cell phone number

    * Role playing was the best way for him (pretending he was lost or calling 911 in an emergency)

* Spanish

* Homesteading
    * tended to seeds

## Notes
* Kai was not thrilled about doing math lesson, but I found a way to make it fun
