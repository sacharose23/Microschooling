## Notes
* Kai made his first serious lie today. He was frustrated that he wasn't focused enough while trying to earn 2 more Kai bucks to get a show (challenge was naming all the letters, him leading it). He was jealous that Rose was watching a show because she cashed in her Rose bucks. He was angry with me so when Dad came home he said I slapped him and I slapped Rose, too. Not sure what his logic was there, but we were disappointed in his choice and explained to him the dangers of lying like that. He was more frustrated when he got in trouble and "raged" in his room a bit. I told Jon to embrace him, knowing he'd "melt". And it worked. He was very remorseful afterwards.
