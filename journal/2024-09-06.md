## Major Accomplishments

*  Both kids love Urban Roots and come home telling what they learned without being prompted. Love of Learning is brewing!
*  Kai mentioned at dinner how important the seeds we're sowing are, how important growing crops is, "what would happen if there were no more grocery stores?!"...his concern was heartwarming

## Activities and events (outside of the house)
* Little Gardeners at Urban Roots
  * learned about carrots and harvesting


## Projects (inside of the house)
* 


## Lessons
* Reading/Writing
  * Kai and Mia practiced letter recognition by hanging up letters all over the room, Mia names a letter, Kai finds it and shoots it with a nerf gun
  
* Math/Business

* Geography

* Spanish

* Homesteading
    * tended to seeds

## Notes
* Kai really got down on himself for missing some letters. We had to pull him away from the exercise because he was overwhelmed and crying. Probably hungry and tired.
