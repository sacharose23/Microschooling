## Final Thoughts (10/7/2023)

**Notes:**

*This week was more unstructured since we've been very busy since we started homeschooling. We slowed down, and I got more organized. I'm taking a step back and rethinking priorities, goals, and task load. The last few days, I've noticed that Kai has been a much better listener. I think it's a combination of a somewhat structured routine, star chart, and martial arts classes. I'd like to prioritize (1) improving/exercising Kai's focus and attention span (2) strengthening his writing.* 

*I think I'm fine with weekly lessons blending with each other instead of just focusing on the theme of the week. We went Apple picking, which wasn't pumpkin picking, but that's totally fine. We took a flower nature walk and watched bees load nectar on the back of their legs. I think taking advantage of moments as they come is natural and valuable.*
