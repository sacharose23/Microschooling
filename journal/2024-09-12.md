## Major Accomplishments

*  Again another great day playing with lots of kids at W&U. I don't know if it's related but Rose's behavior has improved along with increase in socialization. She's using her words more.
*  Rose was FANTASTIC at her first day in Soccer Shots. She was SO impressive, waking up for a nap, putting herself together, and ended up FULLY participating without my help, becoming the Coach's star pupil! So proud!
