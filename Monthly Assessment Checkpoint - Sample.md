# Monthly Assessment Checkpoint (Sample)

[TOC]

Each month, we'll have a 3rd party person review all that Kai and I did in the previous month. We'll hand the person a record, which will most likely be in a 3 ring binder. The original documents will be in digital form. 

### Outline

1. Calendar monthly view with all activities and major events listed. This is an aerial view of the full month.
2. Visual Overview of Progress (sort of like a dashboard view)
   1. Year-to-date by month and comparison to goals
   2. Number of activities/projects/lessons by subject (each activity/project/lesson may have more than one topic/subject)
3. Milestones Chart for Math, Art, Motor, Literacy, & Social Emotional
4. A simple list of all projects/activities/lessons with tags of topic/subject (e.g., math, literature, art, etc.).
5. Full documentation of Projects (typically will only have 1 maybe 2 per month). 
6. Full documentation of Lessons
7. Full documentation of Activities

## Projects

> Project Management, Recycling, Consumer Science, Earth Science, Civic Service

### Lake/River Clean Up

#### Summary

This event was inspired sponateously when Kai decided to discard his lollipop stick into bushes as he was walking on a sidewalk. We discarded it properly, but then discussed why it was important not to litter. It was Kai's idea to organize a clean-up event with friends and family. He wants to pick up track at the beach or in our case, Lake Tahoe or the Truckee River. He specifically wanted his two closest friends to join: Olive and Xander. We planned and organized the event and it went very well. We anticipated problems and came up with solutions. We learned from a few challenges that we did not anticipate. All in all, Kai was very proud of the outcome. Moving forward he wants to be active in more cleanups or similar Earth-loving activities.

#### Research/Planning

* Is there a Lake/River Clean Up we can join?
* What
  * What to call the event?
  * How long?
  * What is recyclable vs what's not recyclable? Simple chart/flyer to hand to everyone.
  * Map out clean up area
  * Incentives 
    * Recognition/reward for the kids...maybe a t-shirt? stickers?
    * Food/Treats/Snacks
    * Gamify
    * Picnic and water fun
    * Sponsors?
* When 
  * Day and time would be good to host this?
    * Early morning to beat the heat
* Where
  * Call Community Organization to find out which beach tends to have the worst trash population
* Who
  * Public or Private?
* How
  * Safety
  * Ease
  * Costs
  * Methods
    * What kind of bags do we need to collect the trash? 
      * paper bags instead of plastic or compostable plastic
      * Eco-friendly gloves

#### Challenges

* Kai learned that sometimes not everyone will share the same enthusiasm as him; sometimes all we can do is try to inspire or lead by example. Maybe we need to incentivize others or make it fun.

#### Review/Outcomes

* Passerbys expressed approval and encouragement of the event
* Kai would like to do this again
* He suggested we round up a bigger group next time
