## Final Thoughts (10/7/2023)

This was one of the busiest and challenging weeks. Toward the end of the week, Kai was REALLY struggling with listening, focus, concentration, & attention. I got so mad, but then realized that it's probably too much stimulation, too many changes, not enough sleep, and maybe even not good enough nutrition. I read somewhere that one of the most important things that homeschooling kids need at this age is quality time/love and nutrition. So, I planned that the next week (P for Pumpkins), we would slow down a bit and I could use the time to get more organized. Maybe it's even a good idea to focus on review from previous weeks. 

We did have a lot of fun this week though. Kai really enjoys doing things with friends.
