# Success Measurements

I believe (before doing research) that at this stage in Kai's learning (Pre-K), most of the measurements we should be tracking are completions. We should keep a growing list of what he's learned (prioritizing milestones) and what his interests are categorized by topic (Math, Literacy, Literature, Science, History/Culture, Art, Homesteading/Home Economics/Family & Consumer Science, Spirituality, Service/Civic, etc.). Quizzing will be for review, progress checking, & assessing mastery. It can be in the form of verbal, written, or demonstration. Whenever possible, there will be an emphasis on teaching or presenting as a way for Kai to prove mastery. I have no doubt Kai will be excited to do this since it's part of his personality - rounding up a crowd or an individual and showing/telling.
